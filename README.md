NEMFusion: A Nighttime Infrared and Visible Image Fusion Framework with Synergistic Illumination Enhancement and Modality Balancing



We establish a synergistic mechanism integrating visual enhancement and feature balance, addressing visible image degradation and modality information imbalance under low illumination conditions. Specifically, the proposed approach innovatively constructs a Dual-branch Feature Enhancement and Decoupling Network (DFEDNet), which performs nonlinear illumination compensation on visible images. Within  DFEDNet, the designed Feature Mining Network (FMN) module enhances dark-region visibility while comprehensively excavating degraded features through its specialized architecture. Moreover, for the challenge of balancing multimodal features under extreme imaging conditions, an Adaptive Gated Fusion Network (AGFNet) is designed to dynamically regulate the complementary features of both modalities, thereby preventing the fusion results from being dominated by single-modality characteristics.
